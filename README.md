<h1>Data Professional Survey Breakdown</h1>

<p>This project is a Power BI visualization of survey data on various aspects of the data professional field, focusing on job satisfaction, salary, and preferred programming languages among data professionals.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of this Power BI dashboard is to provide insights into the data profession based on survey responses. The visualizations cover multiple areas, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Country of Survey Takers</strong> - A breakdown of survey participants by country.</li>
    <li><strong>Average Salary by Job Title</strong> - A comparison of average salaries across different data job roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Favorite Programming Language</strong> - A summary of preferred programming languages among data professionals.</li>
    <li><strong>Happiness with Work-Life Balance and Salary</strong> - Gauges displaying average ratings for work-life balance and salary satisfaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Average Salary by Difficulty to Enter the Field</strong> - A correlation between the average salary and the perceived difficulty of entering the data profession.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visualizations</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Country of Survey Taker</strong>: A stacked chart showing the distribution of survey takers' countries, providing insights into geographic trends within the data profession.</li>
    <li><strong>Average Salary by Job Title</strong>: A bar chart that visualizes the average salary of different data job roles, helping to understand which roles are more financially rewarding.</li>
    <li><strong>Favorite Programming Language</strong>: A bar chart illustrating the most popular programming languages among data professionals, with Python being the top choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Survey Counts and Averages</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Survey Respondents</strong>: 630</li>
            <li><strong>Average Age of Respondents</strong>: 29.87</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Happiness with Work-Life Balance and Salary</strong>: Two gauge charts displaying average ratings for work-life balance (5.74 out of 10) and salary satisfaction (4.27 out of 8.54).</li>
    <li><strong>Difficulty to Break into the Data Field vs. Average Salary</strong>: A chart showing the average salary relative to how difficult respondents found it to break into the data field, highlighting the relationship between salary and entry challenges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Source</h2>

<p>The data used in this project is from a professional survey of individuals in the data industry. The original dataset contains responses on topics such as job titles, salaries, preferred programming languages, job satisfaction, and ease of entering the data field.</p>
